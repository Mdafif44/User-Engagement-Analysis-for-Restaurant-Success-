## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user engagement metrics to understand their impact on restaurant success. By examining various factors such as reviews, tips, check-ins, and the influence of elite users, this research aims to provide valuable insights for businesses in the restaurant industry.

## Research Objectives
- Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and restaurant performance metrics (review count, average star rating).
- Analyze the impact of elite users on restaurant success.
- Identify peak hours and their significance for business operations.
- Examine the sentiment of reviews and its relation to restaurant success.
- Compare restaurant success across different cities.

## Data Sources
- The dataset used in this project is a subset of Yelp data, containing information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.
- The original data is shared by Yelp as JSON files.
- Five JSON files are used in this analysis:
  1. Business
  2. Review
  3. User
  4. Tip
  5. Checkin
- These JSON files have been stored in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.

## Methodology
This project employs a comprehensive approach utilizing various tools and techniques:

1. **SQL**: Used for querying and manipulating the database containing the Yelp dataset.
2. **Python**: Employed for data processing, analysis, and machine learning tasks.
3. **Data Visualization**: Utilized to create meaningful visual representations of the findings.
4. **Data Analytics**: Applied to extract insights and patterns from the dataset.
5. **Big Data**: Techniques used to handle and process the large Yelp dataset efficiently.
6. **Statistics**: Applied for hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and other statistical measurements.

# The analysis workflow typically involves:
1. Data extraction from the database using SQL
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and visualization libraries
4. Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
5. Advanced analytics and potential machine learning model development
6. Visualization of results and insights

## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **User Engagement Impact**: 
   - There is a significant correlation between user engagement and restaurant success metrics.
   - Businesses should focus on strategies to enhance user engagement over time.

2. **Elite User Influence**: 
   - Collaborating with elite users can amplify promotional efforts.
   - Leveraging elite users' influence can increase brand awareness and drive customer acquisition.

3. **Peak Hours Utilization**: 
   - Businesses can adjust their operating hours or introduce special promotions to capitalize on increased demand during peak hours.

4. **Improvement Strategies**: 
   - Less successful businesses should focus on improving service quality and responsively addressing customer feedback.

5. **Geographic Opportunities**: 
   - Cities with high success scores present opportunities for restaurant chains to expand or invest further.


## Future Work
- Deeper analysis of the sentiment in reviews and its impact on success
- Investigating the long-term effects of user engagement on restaurant longevity
- Exploring the impact of external factors (e.g., local events, economic conditions) on restaurant success
